## 🧠 Nguyên nhân
Giải thích **vì sao lỗi xảy ra**  
(Dependency conflict? Version mismatch? Cache?)

## ✅ Cách giải quyết
### Cách 1 (recommended)
- Tìm classpath của gradle trong file "android\build.gradle" sau đó khóa version lại 
     classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.5.2")
### Cách 2 (Khi build cùng expo)
- Cách 2 : Nếu build cùng expo : xóa thư mục android hoặc chạy npx expo prebuild --clean để xóa đi thư mục gradle được import sẵn 
sau đó chạy build lại với eas build -p android
